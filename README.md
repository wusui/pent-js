# My Own Private Functional Programming Pentomino Project

### INTRODUCTION
This project finds all rectangular solutions using 12 free pentominos
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino for more details).  I wrote
this set of javascript functions in order to get used to writing code using
the funtional programming paradigm and to get more proficient at aspects of
javascript which I had never used before (most specifically arrow function
expressions).  This code essentially solves the cases described in the
"Constructing rectangular dimensions" section of the above Wiki link.

This problem seemed well suited for functional programming learning since the
only output is a solution.  The nonfunctionalCaller.js file consists of a call
to the entry point of the solver and uses console.log to output it.  This
program takes no input as all of the knowledge about the pentomino shapes
is generated by the program itself.  It runs in roughly 20 minutes on an AMD
Opteron(tm) Processor 4122 Server running Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS Linux using
node.js v16.13.1.

Everything other than the console log call is either a const function
or an object that is immediately frozen.  As far as I can tell, no parameters
are changed by the execution of this program.  So I believe that this code is
a pure functional programming implementation.

###GENERAL ALGORITHM
This program recursively tries placing different pentominos in a grid.  When adding
a pentomino, the position that is selected to place a pentomino is the leftmost highest
empty square.  With this restriction, we know that any square in the pentomino added will
not be further left of that square, and any square in the pentomino in the same column
as that square will be lower in the grid.  We also know that every square in the pentomino
will be at most 4 horizontal + vertical steps away from that starting square.  So the figure
below is a template of all possible square locations that a pentomino can have relative to
the starting point (X in this figure).
